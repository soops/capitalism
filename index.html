Capitalism: Risky Business

Players: 2+

You Will Need: At least one die, optionally a full set of Monopoly money for scorekeeping.

Terminology: 
Bank: Infinite money bank. Do not take from or add to unless told to do so.

Rules: 
Capitalism: Risky Business is a game about money, power, and business. You must make decisions for your company to boost your success and hinder othersâ€™ success, but at the same time, your competitors are chasing the same goal.

Start by giving $500 from the bank to each player. The youngest player goes first. During a turn, a player should roll a die to decide what choices they have. Then, the player will decide on a choice and carry out the chosen described choice. After you finish the choice, your turn is over. Turns should continue clockwise from the youngest player. If you go below $0, you are out of the game. To win, you must either be the first player with at least $1,500 or be the last player standing.

Choices: 
If you roll a one, you can either: 
- Put $100 of your own money in the bank, or, 
- Take $100 from the bank and give it to an opponent.

If you roll a two, you can either: 
- Put $100 of an opponentâ€™s money in the bank, or, 
- Take $100 from the bank for yourself.

If you roll a three, you can either: 
- Take $100 dollars from an opponent for yourself, or, 
- Take $200 dollars from the bank for yourself.

If you roll a four, you can either: 
- Set a wager and pick a number between 1-6 (inclusive). Roll a die and if the number on the die matches your number, take the wager amount from the bank and keep the money you set. If the number doesnâ€™t match, keep only half the wager, and put the rest in the bank. 
- Or, do nothing.

If you roll a five, you can either: 
- Choose a player to gamble with. Have your opponent put $100 into the wager and then put $100 of your own money into the wager. Call a coin flip, and then flip a coin. Whoever called the coin correctly takes all of the wager. 
- Or, take $100 from the bank for yourself.

If you roll a six, you can either: 
- Flip a coin. If heads, take $200 from the bank for yourself. If tails, put $200 in the bank. 
- Or, take $50 from the bank for yourself.
