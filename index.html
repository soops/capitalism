<p><strong>Players:</strong> 2+</p>

<p><strong>You Will Need:</strong> At least one die, optionally a full set of Monopoly money for scorekeeping.</p>

<p><strong>Terminology:</strong> <br>
<em>Bank:</em> Infinite money bank. Do not take from or add to unless told to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong> <br>
Capitalism: Risky Business is a game about money, power, and business. You must make decisions for your company to boost your success and hinder others’ success, but at the same time, your competitors are chasing the same goal.</p>

<p>Start by giving $500 from the bank to each player. The youngest player goes first. During a turn, a player should roll a die to decide what choices they have. Then, the player will decide on a choice and carry out the chosen described choice. After you finish the choice, your turn is over. Turns should continue clockwise from the youngest player. If you go below $0, you are out of the game. To win, you must either be the first player with at least $1,500 or be the last player standing.</p>

<p><strong>Choices:</strong> <br>
If you roll a <strong>one,</strong> you can either: <br>
- Put $100 of your own money in the bank, or, <br>
- Take $100 from the bank and give it to an opponent.</p>

<p>If you roll a <strong>two</strong>, you can either: <br>
- Put $100 of an opponent’s money in the bank, or, <br>
- Take $100 from the bank for yourself.</p>

<p>If you roll a <strong>three</strong>, you can either: <br>
- Take $100 dollars from an opponent for yourself, or, <br>
- Take $200 dollars from the bank for yourself.</p>

<p>If you roll a <strong>four</strong>, you can either: <br>
- Set a wager and pick a number between 1-6 (inclusive). Roll a die and if the number on the die matches your number, take the wager amount from the bank and keep the money you set. If the number doesn’t match, keep only half the wager, and put the rest in the bank. <br>
- Or, do nothing.</p>

<p>If you roll a <strong>five</strong>, you can either: <br>
- Choose a player to gamble with. Have your opponent put $100 into the wager and then put $100 of your own money into the wager. Call a coin flip, and then flip a coin. Whoever called the coin correctly takes all of the wager. <br>
- Or, take $100 from the bank for yourself.</p>

<p>If you roll a <strong>six</strong>, you can either: <br>
- Flip a coin. If heads, take $200 from the bank for yourself. If tails, put $200 in the bank. <br>
- Or, take $50 from the bank for yourself.</p>
